# This repository is depreciated.

In accordance to OpenRA's recent mod template system encouraging modders to soft-fork the engine as well as reaching limits of what's possible within a third-party plugin without changes in `OpenRA.Mods.Common` namespace (see issue #5 or `FireArmamentPower`'s `MaximumFiringInstances` tag which never worked properly due to this), this project is deprecated in favor of a soft-fork.

Attacque Supérior engine development is continued under https://github.com/AttacqueSuperior/Engine.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience this might cause. Below you can find the original README of this project.

## This repository is a collection of mod-specific logics for the OpenRA mod Attacque Supérior.

While the logics might be written with one mod in mind, the repository's aim is to be used by the modding community as an additional plugin for their mods.

The repository will be aimed against the bleed version of OpenRA. Playtest-compatible versions might be tagged though. Release-specific versions probably not - although probably the last playtest of that release cycle will work with them.

For specific mod logic authors, refer the AUTHORS file. The repository's code is under the GPLv3 license. All code uploaded into this repository follows the OpenRA code standard and was evaulated by StyleCop.

Do not ask about the mod here. This is a strict code repository. You can follow Attacque Supérior at http://www.moddb.com/mods/attacque-suprior or https://www.facebook.com/AttacqueSuperior.
